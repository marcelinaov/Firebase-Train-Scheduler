# Firebase-Train-Scheduler

In this assignment, a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase was created to host arrival and departure data. This app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
